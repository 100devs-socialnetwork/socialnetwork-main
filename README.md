# Introduction

We built out a social network app using the MVC Architecture, with user profiles, the ability to create posts, add likes and delete, and a feed. Our goal was to build a node app with some complex features.

> Note: The project is still in the early stages of development. We will be working on adding more
> styles, implementing new features and more good stuff.
